<p class="statement">One of the biggest challenges to eating at home is cooking. This is because people either may not
    have time to decide on a meal they’d like to try or they can’t figure out what ingredients are necessary for meals.
    People also want to save time and money. But oftentimes, they find themselves spending more time trying to decide
    what to eat rather than cooking meals. This leads to eating out and spending more money on groceries and take out.
    Overall, wasting time, money and food.

<!--  Introduction -->

 <!--  Research Section -->

     <div class="contentResearch">
            <H2> <strong> Research </strong></H2>

            <h5>Objectives</h5>

            <p class="researchContent"> We wanted to understand what were the challenges when it comes to feeding a family. We all had our experiences as to why it could be difficult to meal plan for our own lifestyles but we kept brainstorming as we began our research. In order to conduct our research precisely to our goal, we pinpointed our objectives which are the following:
                <ul class="research-lists">
                    <li>Identify most users' current meal planning habits</li>
                    <li>Understand users typical food preferences and tastes</li>
                    <li>Discover user pain points of feeding a family on a weekly basis</li>
             </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="researchContent">
                    Thus, we began our competitor analysis to see how we can develop our app and see what is currently in the market.
                </p>

                <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
            
                <p class="researchContent">
                    We began investigating apps who were mobile, popular amongst the app store, and had similar features among one another.
                    We assessed features to identify how we can break out of the mold and provide features that can stand out on their own
                    while still providing fundamental necessities our users require.</p>
                    <img src="Pantry Images/competitor-analysis.png"
                        style="width: 800px; margin-left: 17%;margin-top: 3%;margin-bottom: 4%;">

                    <h5>Proto Persona</h5>

                    <p class="researchContent">
                        To understand who Pantry users are, we began with sending a survey questionnaire with demographics and general questions
                        about meal planning and cooking. With the results from the survey, we were able to create a persona. This enabled us to
                        understand our users' needs based on their gains and pain points.
                        <img src="Pantry Images/proto-persona copy.png" style="width: 800px; margin-left: 6%;margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 4%;">


                    <h5>User Interviews</h5>
                    <p class="researchContent">
                        We sent a preliminary survey in order to gauge our users along with creating our proto persona then we used it to
                        determine who would fit our criteria for interviews. With a user in mind, we created a research interview plan that had
                        open-ended questions that developed from our main objectives to provide us a deeper insight to our user’s motivations
                        and psyche. Thus we started to recruit our participants for our interview. We recruited five participants to interview
                        that enabled us to gain insight to confirm if our initial comprehension of our users were accurate from our survey and
                        proto persona. We discovered the following insights:   <ul class="research-lists">
                            <li>Most reuse their dinners for tomorrow’s lunch</li>
                            <li>Having a shopping list with food listed by aisle is desirable to our users</li>
                            <li>Most decide what to eat by process of elimination</li>
                            <li>Most don’t know what they have already in their pantry when they go shopping</li>
                            <li>Time is a common issue</li>
                            <li>Most plan dinner last minute</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <p class="researchContent">
                    After our interviews, we gathered our plan and notes to begin defining and ideating Pantry. 
                </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Define & Ideate  -->

        <div class="contentDefSynth">
            <H2> <strong> Define & Ideate </strong></H2>
            <p class="defsynthContent"> We began by synthesizing data from our survey and interviews to help us to identify how we
                can resolve the challenges facing our users goal's when it comes to meal planning. </p>

            <h5>Affinity Diagram</h5>

            <p class="defsynthContent">
                We organized our interview insights using an Affinity Diagram that included demographics and snippets of comments from
                our participants. We inspected our diagram for common patterns between our users and organized the notes by sorting them
                into groups.</p>
                <img src="Pantry Images/affinity-diagram-insights copy.png" style="width: 900px; margin-left: 10.5%;margin-top: 3%;">
                <img src="Pantry Images/affinity-diagram-grouped.png"style="width: 920px; margin-left: 14%;margin-top: 3%;margin-bottom: 5%;">
            
            <h5>Empathy Map</h5>
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                After grouping our insights we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how our user’s empathize with their meal
                planning. We used an empathy map to distinguish our user’s modes of perception and how they connect with meal
                planning and how we can create solutions for these perceptions.
            </p>
            <img src="Pantry Images/empathy-map copy.png"style="width: 800px; margin-left: 15.5%;margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                From our deduced data, we discovered the needs for our site to address both pains and gains expressed from our user.
                However, we desired to stay centered on our specific user so we began with composing a user persona.
            </p>
            <br>
           <h5>User Persona</h5>
           <p class="defsynthContent">
            With the insight from our empathy map and affinity diagram, We wanted to ensure we had a focal user as we began to ideate and know who to design for. We created our user persona Leann Simone Genovese!
        </p>
        <img src="Pantry Images/pantry user persona copy.png"style="width: 600px; margin-left: 23%;margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 8%;">
        <p class="defsynthContent">
            Now with a better understanding of who our Pantry user is, their pains and gains. We 
            gathered our top features and began to dissect which features will provide our user with their needs.            
    </p>

    <h5>Feature Prioritization Matrix</h5>
    
    <p class="defsynthContent">
        We wanted to ensure we were prioritizing features that were beneficial to our users and available per our capacity
        to develop into Pantry. With understanding what the sense our users have per our Empathy Map we knew how we can
        create solutions for these perceptions but how that looked like Feature wise is why we develop our feature
        Prioritization to see if it is feasible as well. </p>
    <img src="Pantry Images/Feature Prior Matrix.jpeg" style="width: 950px; margin-left: 7.5%;">
    <p class="defsynthContent">After we organized the features we wanted to center Pantry for our users, so we started sketching our ideas. </p>

    <h5>Lo-fi Wireframe Sketches</h5>
    <p class="defsynthContent">
        Our wireframe sketches were on the main pages our users would interact with. Before ideating the rest of Pantry, we had
        to ensure we knew the steps our users would take to accomplish their goals in Pantry. Thus, we started mapping a user
        flow.
        </p>

<h5>User Flow</h5>
<p class="defsynthContent">
    In order to understand the journey of our users, we needed to see the steps they would take while interacting with
    Pantry. It was complex based on different tasks that our users would try to accomplish. We iterated three times
    before we reached our final mapping to ensure the flow was intuitive and we could provide a design that provides all
    the content they need to interact with Pantry.

 <div class="prototestContent">
            <H2> <strong> Prototyping & Testing </strong></H2>
            <p class="protoContent">
                To test the functionality of our design, we conducted usability testing early into our prototype to ensure we could
                refine our app and iterate our final prototype to be functional and intuitive to our users.
            </p>
                
            <h5>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes & Prototype</h5>
            <p class="protoContent"> Starting our prototype began with creating our wireframes using Adobe XD.Once we had created
                our wireframes, we used Adobe XD to make our limited functional prototype.</p>

            <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
            <p class="protoContent">
                Our usability testing was done remote via Zoom with a moderated Think Aloud method. We recruited five participants
                to test our design’s functionality by stating their thoughts on how they felt, what they saw, and their actions
                while going testing the site by completing tasks given. We formulated tasks based on our main pages which were our
                homepage, cravings quiz, meal calendar and recipes. We used Miroboard to take notes of the tasks and notes from
                feedback and repeated for our interactions and notes for revisions.The following is the feedback received:
            <ul class="research-lists">
                    <li>Fix craving quiz to go to next questions</li>
                    <li>Remove plus button</li>
                    <li>Adjust cravings quiz to home page</li>
                    <li>Fix link to cravings quiz</li>
                    <li>Discovered extra step to meal plan process to eliminate</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <img src="Pantry Images/Testing Usability Analysis.jpeg" style="width: 950px; margin-left: 9%; margin-top: 3%;">


            <h5>Revisions</h5>
            <p class="protoContent">
                We had three iterations per the feedback that we received.It was vital to ensure our app was friendly and functional due to the complexity of our problem. We wanted to ensure our app was intuitive and friendly which had us going back and iterating our user flow as well. We used our feedback and made revisions. Our final usability testing phase reception was considered great among our users testing and provided additional recommendations on how to grow Pantry with additional features. The following were all our revisions per our feedback:
                <ul class="research-lists">
                    <li>Fix craving quiz to go to next questions</li>
                    <li>Remove plus button</li>
                    <li>Adjust cravings quiz to home page</li>
                    <li>Fix link to cravings quiz</li>
                    <li>Discovered extra step to meal plan process to eliminate</li>
                    <li>Add skip button to onboarding</li>
                    <li>Add home button instead of logo for home function</li>
                    <li>Broken “like” feature</li>
                    <li>Fix "Eat out" section to suggestions instead of recipes</li>
                    <li>Add more pictures</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="protoContent">  Once we had refined our flow and general wireframe layout. We began branding Pantry.</p>
            
            <H2> <strong> Branding</strong></H2>
            <p class="protoContent">
                Before applying UI design to our wireframes, we wanted to ensure that the site had a theme with precise motif and continuity. We began with food and meal planning but needed to narrow our brand to a specific theme to ensure there wasn't an overlap with our competitors and other apps that relate to just food. 
        </p>

        <h5>Mood Board</h5>
        <p class="protoContent">
            We began seeking inspiration via Google search images and Pinterest. We searched for pantry, planners, grocery lists, recipe/recipe lists and food organization. Along with food icons and colors that can present the tone of Pantry which we sought for a modern, clean, organized, and warm.

                After designing our logo and solidifying elements of the Pantry brand. We created our  style guide with the intention to complement our key UI elements. Then we applied our style guide to our wireframes.

                We learned a lot about how complicated the modes of perception are when it comes to food creation and the impact it has
                for each individual on a day to day basis. The market for this is enormous and takes a lot of features to tailor the
                many different lifestyles and preferences each persona requires to deem a practical and useful app. Our most enticing

                Pantry future opportunities will be to add the following features:
